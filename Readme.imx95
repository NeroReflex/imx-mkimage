1. i.MX95 uses dedicated SOC type, so must set "SOC=iMX95"

2. By default, OEI image is not used. To use OEI image, only need to add "OEI=YES" in command. The "OEI=YES" is pertained to all targets to enable OEI.
   The default name of OEI images are: oei.bin.ca55 (singleboot) and oei.bin.cm33 (lpboot)
   For exmaple,
	a) Non-OEI image for singleboot:
		make SOC=iMX95 flash_singleboot

	b) OEI image for singleboot:
		make SOC=iMX95 OEI=YES flash_singleboot

3. To run System manager, could use below targets. If need to use M33 OEI image, add "OEI=YES"
	a) System manager only
	make SOC=iMX95 flash_lpboot_sm
	make SOC=iMX95 flash_lpboot_sm_no_ahabfw

	b) System manager with M7 in TCM or DDR
	make SOC=iMX95 flash_lpboot_sm_m7
	make SOC=iMX95 flash_lpboot_sm_m7_no_ahabfw
	make SOC=iMX95 flash_lpboot_sm_m7_ddr
	make SOC=iMX95 flash_lpboot_sm_m7_ddr_no_ahabfw

	c) System manager with A55 from sd/emmc or flexspi nor
	make SOC=iMX95 flash_lpboot_sm_a55
	make SOC=iMX95 flash_lpboot_sm_a55_no_ahabfw
	make SOC=iMX95 flash_lpboot_sm_a55_flexspi

	d) System manager with A55 + M7 (TCM)
	make SOC=iMX95 flash_lpboot_sm_all
	make SOC=iMX95 flash_lpboot_sm_all_no_ahabfw

   Note: For iMX95 "UBOOT_LOAD_ADDR is set to 0x90200000", please ensure your u-boot is latest and uses this address.
   Otherwise set the UBOOT_LOAD_ADDR to your address

4. The DDR Firmware used by default is LPDDR5 (for both OEI or Non-OEI), to generate image with LPDDR4x or LPDDR4,
   set the "LPDDR_TYPE=lpddr4"
